         This directory contains licenses and documentation for the
         Tinker software package. The top-level directory contain PDF
         files for the Tinker and FFE User's Guides, a Tinker summary,
         and the academic and commercial licenses.

         The /sphinx directory contains Sphinx source files needed to
         build HTML and PDF documentation for Tinker and FFE. The HTML
         is found in the tinker/_build/html and ffe/_build/html areas,
         while the PDFs are in the corresponding _build/latex areas.

         The /word directory has ".docx" files in Microsoft Word format.
         The other subdirectories contain logo images and additional
         documentation for Tinker and locally developed force fields.
