                    SOURCE Directory for the Tinker Package
                    #######################################

         This directory contains Fortran source code for the current
         version of the Tinker program package.

         The code is in a standard Fortran dialect that should compile
         unchanged on most machines. Script files to build the package
         on a variety of systems are in subdirectories named for the
         machine/operating system. A Makefile is also provided.

         Only a few source files may require editing prior to building:
         "sizes.f" which contains some master array dimensions used
         throughout the package, and "openend.f" which is a system
         dependent routine to open a file at the end.

         If you are building an OpenMP-capable version of Tinker with
         the Intel Fortran compiler, then it is necessary to uncomment
         the calls to Intel-specific extensions "kmp_set_stacksize_s"
         and "kmp_set_blocksize" near the top of the file "initial.f".

         In addition, if your system does not support the iargc/getarg
         mechanism for command line arguments, then comment out the
         call to the subroutine "command" at the bottom of "initial.f".
