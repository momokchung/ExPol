                   Building OpenMM-Enabled Tinker Executables
                   ##########################################

       This directory contains the files needed to build Tinker versions
       of the ANALYZE, BAR and DYNAMIC programs using the GPU-capable
       OpenMM libraries. The files in this directory should be copied
       into the /source directory of a clean distribution of Tinker, and
       the programs can be compiled and linked in that modified /source
       directory.

       The provided Makefile can be used, after minor edits, to build
       GPU-enabled executables. Either the GNU compilers or the Intel
       compilers can be used. The Makefile assumes OpenMM is found in
       its default location, /usr/local/openmm. NVIDIA CUDA V9 or later
       must be installed on the target machine, as well as a CUDA-capable
       graphics card.

       This version of the Tinker interface code to OpenMM should work
       correctly when built against the current Github master version of
       the OpenMM package, available from https://github.com/openmm/.
       Only a limited set of Tinker options are available from within the
       Tinker-OpenMM programs, including Amber and AMOEBA force fields,
       Verlet and RESPA MD integrators, Bussi thermostat and the Monte
       Carlo barostat. Only PME periodic box calculations are supported.
