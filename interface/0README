                   Interface Code between Tinker and Tinker9
                   #########################################

      This directory contains scripts and code that generates interface
      information to allow the Tinker9 GPU package to call routines from
      the Fortran-based CPU Tinker package.

      Procedure to generate the interface code:

      (1) Save the file below from the Tinker9 Github repository into
          the current /interface directory under the name "export":

          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkerTools \
             /tinker9/master/ext/interface/export

      (2) Run the command "bash export update" to check if updates are
          available at the Tinker9 GitHub site. This command provides
          the files "export", "parse.py" and "version.txt", as well as
          an /include subdirectory.

      (3) Run the command "bash export c cpp". Once this it finishes,
          it creates "CMakeLists.txt" and /c and /cpp subdirectories
          containing header files for the Tinker routines.
