                     APBS Libraries for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

      This directory contains static APBS libraries required to interface
      the Tinker package with the APBS 1.3 Poisson-Boltzmann code written
      by Nathan Baker and coworkers.

      If the libraries are not present here, then you should obtain the
      APBS 1.3 code and build your own libraries by following the protocol
      in the file /apbs/0README.
