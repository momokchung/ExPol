               Tinker Notes for Intel Fortran Compiler for macOS
               #################################################

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the Tinker program package on an Intel-based
         Macintosh system using the Intel Fortran Compiler for macOS.

         Building OpenMP parallel executables requires uncommenting
         the two Intel-specific routine calls kmp_set_stacksize_s and
         kmp_set_blocksize in the source file initial.f.

         Please note that by default the macOS distributions limit
         stacksize and datasize for processes as can be checked via
         the csh limit command or similar. Large Tinker executables
         will need these values increased to avoid failure at startup.
