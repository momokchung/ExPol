                     MAKE Directory for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

        This subdirectory contains a Unix-style Makefile that can be used
        to build the Tinker modeling package. The provided file will need
        modification to point to the local Tinker directory, and for use
        with machine and compiler combinations not described near the top
        of the Makefile.

        A list of the dependencies of source files on each other, to be
        added at the bottom of the Makefile, is generated via the Tinker
        "document" program by running the "depend.make" script from within
        the source directory.

        A python script that will build a new Makefile with the correct
        source dependencies is provided as "buildmake.py". This script
        should be run with the location of the Tinker source files as an
        argument, e.g., "./buildmake.py ../source/*.f > Makefile".

        Alternatively, Tinker can be built by running the compile.make,
        library.make and link.make scripts provided in machine specific
        directories of the Tinker distribution.
