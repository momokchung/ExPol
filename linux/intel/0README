               Tinker Notes for Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux
               #################################################

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the Tinker program package on an Intel-based
         Linux system using the Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux. The
         use of the "generic.make" compile script restricts the Intel
         compiler to SSE3-compatible instructions, and the resulting
         executables should run on most AMD-based machines.

         Building OpenMP parallel executables requires uncommenting
         the two Intel-specific routine calls kmp_set_stacksize_s and
         kmp_set_blocksize in the source file initial.f.

         Please note that by default most Linux distributions limit
         stacksize and datasize for processes, as can be checked via
         the csh limit command or similar. Calculations on big systems
         will need these values increased to avoid failure at startup.
