                    Python Directory for the Tinker Package
                    #######################################

      This directory contains Python programs and utilities for use with
      the Tinker package. At the moment the only content is a Python free
      energy tool similar to the Tinker BAR program, and a utility for the
      construction of "Boresch" free energy restraints. These Python code
      versions are by Francis Jing in the Ren lab at Univ Texas at Austin.
